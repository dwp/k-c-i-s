		<li>New versions of this page created for each interaction type. The original design with 7 text fields is approriate on for potentially complex in-person interactions. Other interaction types may use a simpler interface to drive down time/cost by reducing journey time. This is currently the page that takes the most time to complete. </li>
		<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">		
			<li><strong>Telephone</strong> - agreed in UCD team that witnesses question wasn't relevant for telephone interactions. Merged other questions into 5 checkboxes, removed full stops (not complete sentences) and reworded lead-in in bold to clarify action<br>
			Dev story: <a href="https://dwpdigital.atlassian.net/browse/CITI-18735">Discover: Add Description - Custom Telephone</a></li>
			<li><strong>Written</strong> - agreed in UCD team that witnesses question wasn't relevant for telephone interactions. Merged other questions into 5 checkboxes, added clarification to checkboxes about starting and ending, removed full stops (not complete sentences) and reworded lead-in in bold to clarify action<br>
			Dev story: <a href="https://dwpdigital.atlassian.net/browse/CITI-19013">Discover: Add Description - Custom Written</a></li>
			<li><strong>Video</strong> - agreed in UCD team that all questions are relevant for video interactions. Merged questions into 6 checkboxes, removed full stops (not complete sentences) and reworded lead-in in bold to clarify action<br>
			Dev story: <a href="https://dwpdigital.atlassian.net/browse/CITI-19015">Discover: Add Description - Custom Video</a></li>
			<li><strong>Social media</strong> - agreed in UCD team that only three questions were relevant for social media interactions (in part because this is generally passively-consumed not active discussion). Questions -> 3 checkboxes, removed full stops (not complete sentences) and reworded lead-in in bold to clarify action. Needs discussion with DWP social media team<br>
			Dev story: <a href="https://dwpdigital.atlassian.net/browse/CITI-19014">Discover: Add Description - Custom Social Media</a></li>
			<li><strong>Error page</strong> for all checkbox versions (all versions except in-person) - errors need to be generic enough to cover any wording around checkboxes</li>
			<li><strong>In person</strong> (not built). The version was designed for in-person, however not built because there is evidence to suggest this<br>
