          <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">1. Why was the customer in contact with us?</h3>
          <p class="govuk-body">Customer attended the site for a unplanned appointment.

          <p class="govuk-body">I invited the customer over to my desk and asked the customer how I can help him. The customer said he is unhappy with the fact that his payment has been suspended and his claim is ‘messed up’. He then told me that his situation is really serious and says he will show everyone how serious it is.

          <p class="govuk-body">The customer  then opend up the bag he is carrying and shows that he has a long bladed knife. He says that I will be saving lives if I can sort out his claim. He tells me that he has been ‘unstable’ from a young age. He said that the rest of the office is in danger if his benefit isn’t paid. He also states that he knows where people live and that he has followed people home.  The customer went on to make threatening statements – saying he believes he will only get help by threatening the lives of other people.

            I advised the customer the appointment had ended and requested the customer to leave which they refused and shouted saying I hadn't been fucking listening what he had said and you will all be sorry.  
I activated my desk alarm to get help,

<p>My colleague (G4S security guard) says:</p>

<p>I responded to a desk alarm activated by my colleague at desk C12. She advised the customer refused to leave the site on termination of the appointment.  The customer swore and shouted the workcoach hadn't been fucking listening to what he had said and you will all be sorry. </p>

          <p class="govuk-body">Following the incident I was alerted that a customer had brought a weapon into the JCP site and made a verbal threat to my staff. I spoke with the reporter about the incident, she was visibly shocked about what happened and agreed for her to work back off house for the remainder of the day. I immediately contacted the Police to advise of the threat made along with carrying a bladed weapon into the site.  I have also made arrangements for Anne to be escorted to her car when she leaves the site for assurance on their safety. </p>

          <p>I would like the customer banned from the office as I don't feel face to face interactions would be safe to continue for the moment. </p>
