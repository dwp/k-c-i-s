Call Agent asked customer not to make these kind of comments but claimant then threatened to go to the local jobcentre and 'cause a scene', and 'slice people up'. Call dropped. No Line Manager comments received. Prompted by BST. Threat Guidance issued. Proceeded to decision due to imminent threat.</p>
