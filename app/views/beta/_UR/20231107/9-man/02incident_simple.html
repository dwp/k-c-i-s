          <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">1. Why was the customer in contact with us?</h3>
          <p class="govuk-body">Customer attended the site for a unplanned appointment.

          <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">2. How did the incident start? Was there a specific trigger?</h3>
          <p class="govuk-body">I invited the customer over to my desk and asked the customer how I can help him. The customer said he is unhappy with the fact that his payment has been suspended and his claim is ‘messed up’. He then told me that his situation is really serious and says he will show everyone how serious it is.

          <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">3. What were the issues with the customer's behaviour?</h3>
          <p class="govuk-body">The customer  then opend up the bag he is carrying and shows that he has a long bladed knife. He says that I will be saving lives if I can sort out his claim. He tells me that he has been ‘unstable’ from a young age. He said that the rest of the office is in danger if his benefit isn’t paid. He also states that he knows where people live and that he has followed people home.  The customer went on to make threatening statements – saying he believes he will only get help by threatening the lives of other people.

          <p class="govuk-body">
            I advised the customer the appointment had ended and requested the customer to leave which they refused and shouted saying I hadn't been fucking listening what he had said and you will all be sorry.  
I activated my desk alarm to get help,
