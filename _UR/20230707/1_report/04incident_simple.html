          <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">Tell us about the incident</h3>
          <p class="govuk-body">I contacted the customer as he wished to make a complaint regarding his recent appointment in the Job Centre. Customer felt that he had not been treated fairly as he was English and we are in Wales. Customer would not let me speak to explain the reason for the appointment and why the Work Coach had asked him to supply additional information. 
          </p>  
          <p class="govuk-body">Customer continued to talk over me and called me racist, he advised that had he come over by boat he would be given better treatment or if he was a druggie he would be given additional money. I tried to calm the customer down but he continually spoke. I asked him to listen to me and what I was trying to tell him but he would not. I terminated the call. This isn't the first time I have had dealings with this customer both via telephone and face to face. He tries to intimidate by not letting you speak. I did feel a little intimidated by him but more frustration.
